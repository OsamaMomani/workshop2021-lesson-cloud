## The `kubectl` command

Just as `gcloud` is the *one command to rule them all* for the GCP, the `kubectl` command is the main tool for interacting with your K8s cluster. You will use it to do essentially anything in the cluster. [Here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/) is the official *cheatsheet*, which is very useful but already very long.

Let's run a few examples.

* Get the status of the nodes in your cluster:

```
kubectl get nodes  
```

* Get the cluster info:

```
kubectl cluster-info  # Display addresses of the master and services

```

Let's list some kubernetes components:

* Check pods

```
kubectl get pod
```

* Check the services

```
kubectl get services
```

We don't have much going on.  Let's create some components.

* Inspect the `create` operation

```
kubectl create -h
```
Note there is no `pod` on the list, so in K8s you don't create pods but *deployments*.  These will create pods, which will run under the hood.

* Let's create an application, it does not matter which.  Let's go for `nginx`:

```
kubectl create deployment mynginx-depl --image=nginx
```

The `nginx` image will be pulled down from the Docker Hub.
This is the most minimalist way of creating a deployment.

* Check the deployments

```
kubectl get deployment
```

* Check pods

```
kubectl get pod
```

## Yaml Files

Another way of creating components in a K8s cluster is trough yaml files.  These are intuitive, logical and configurable, although very picky about identation.

Let's take a look at one of these files, [nginx-deployment.yaml](https://gitlab.com/nanuchi/youtube-tutorial-series/-/raw/master/kubernetes-configuration-file-explained/nginx-deployment.yaml):

~~~
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.16
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
~~~
{: .language-yaml}

Let's delete our previous deployment and deploy using the yaml file:

* Delete deployments

```
kubectl delete deployment mynginx-depl
```

* Deploy using yaml files

```
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
```

## Namespaces

Namespaces are a kind of reservations in your K8s cluster.  Let's create one for the Argo workflow we will user

```
kubectl create ns <NAMESPACE>
```

## Argo

While jobs can also be run manually, a workflow engine makes defining and submitting jobs easier. In this tutorial, we use [argo quick start](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/quick-start/) page to install it:

```
kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOURNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUREMAIL@gmail.com
kubectl create ns argo
kubectl apply -n argo -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/stable/manifests/quick-start-postgres.yaml
```

Download argo CLI:

```
# Download the binary
curl -sLO https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/releases/download/v3.1.2/argo-linux-amd64.gz

# Unzip
gunzip argo-linux-amd64.gz

# Make binary executable
chmod +x argo-linux-amd64

# Move binary to path
sudo mv ./argo-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/argo

# Test installation
argo version
```


Run a simple test flow:

```
argo submit -n argo --watch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/master/examples/hello-world.yaml
argo list -n argo
argo get -n argo @latest
argo logs -n argo @latest
```


## Storage volumes

If we run some application or workflow, we usually require a disk space where to dump our results.  There is no persistent disk by default, we have to create it.

You could create a disk clicking on the web interface above, but lets do it faster in the command line.

Create the volume (disk) we are going to use

```
gcloud compute disks create --size=100GB --zone=us-central1-c gce-nfs-disk-1
```

Set up an nfs server for this disk:

```
wget https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshop2021-lesson-cloud/files/001-nfs-server.yaml
kubectl apply -n argo -f 001-nfs-server.yaml
```

Set up a nfs service, so we can access the server:

```
wget https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshop2021-lesson-cloud/files/002-nfs-server-service.yaml
kubectl apply -n argo -f 002-nfs-server-service.yaml
```

Let's find out the IP of the nfs server:

```
kubectl get -n argo svc nfs-server |grep ClusterIP | awk '{ print $3; }'
```

Let's create a *persisten volume* out of this nfs disk.  Note that persisten volumes are not namespaced they are available to the whole cluster.

We need to write that IP number above into the appropriate place in this file:

```
wget https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshop2021-lesson-cloud/files/003-pv.yaml
```

~~~
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: nfs-1
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 100Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  nfs:
    server: <Add IP here>
    path: "/"
~~~
{: .language-yaml}

Deploy:

```
kubectl apply -f 003-pv.yaml
```

Check:

```
kubectl get pv
```

Apps can claim persistent volumes through *persistent volume claims* (pvc).  Let's create a pvc:

```
wget https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshop2021-lesson-cloud/files/003-pvc.yaml
kubectl apply -n argo -f 003-pvc.yaml
```
Check:

```
kubectl get pvc -n argo
```

Now an argo workflow coul claim and access this volume with a configuration like:

~~~
# argo-wf-volume.ysml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: test-hostpath-
spec:
  entrypoint: test-hostpath
  volumes:
    - name: task-pv-storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: nfs-<NUMBER>
  templates:
  - name: test-hostpath
    script:
      image: alpine:latest
      command: [sh]
      source: |
        echo "This is the ouput" > /mnt/vol/test.txt
        echo ls -l /mnt/vol: `ls -l /mnt/vol`
      volumeMounts:
      - name: task-pv-storage
        mountPath: /mnt/vol
~~~
{: .language-yaml}


Now the workflow could access the disk. However is rather cumbersome to get the ouput outside the cluster.  One of he best ways to do that is to follow similar procedures to set up an http cluster for example.

As you can see all these tasks take time.  The good news is that there are tools to make the cluster creation and the setting up of volumes, pvs, pvcs, servers, services, etc., automatic.  This is what we will be doing for you for the upcoming hands-on part of this lesson.

You will continue learning about this, hands-on, tomorrow.
